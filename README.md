# C++ DSA Repository

A structured collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in C++.  
Includes clean code, organized topic-wise folders, explanations, and optimized solutions.  
Created as part of my journey to strengthen problem-solving skills and master core computer science fundamentals.

## 🛠️ How to Run

Compile any file using a C++ compiler (g++, clang or MinGW):

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
